class LRUCache:
    """
    This is an alternative implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using Python's built-in OrderedDict.

    LRU cache is used to store a fixed number of key-value pairs such that when the cache is full, 
    the least recently used item is removed to make space for new entries.

    Data Structures Used:
    ---------------------
    - OrderedDict:
        A subclass of dict that remembers the order keys were inserted.
        This is ideal for LRU, because we want to keep track of the usage order.
        - Keys at the beginning are least recently used.
        - Keys at the end are most recently used.

    - No need for a separate doubly linked list and hashmap manually â€” OrderedDict handles both functionalities.

    Time Complexity:
    ----------------
    - get/put operations: O(1) average-case time
